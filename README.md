# it1244-project
 Project for NUS IT1244 by Team 8 - Chia Kwang Yang, Lee Weng Heng Jon,  Lim Zhiyong, Qiu Zihao 

# How to run the project:
We have created a predict.py script for you to test the models out.
You can run the predict.py yourself.
If you would like to test with other values, you can make a copy of the dictionary provided in the file itself to preserve the original values and meddle with the other values in the dictionary. 

Do note that there are some libraries that you would have to download to work this project.
You can find the libraries in the requirements.txt file.
